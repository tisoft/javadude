UI for ANTXR 2.7.6

Features:
  - editor which is aware of ANTXR grammar (syntax highlighting)
  - outline page which shows sections of ANTXR grammar files (content of a
    modified grammar file editor is parsed every second and the according
    outline is updated with the resulting grammar file model)
  - JSR-45 grammar-level debugging for ANTXR grammars
  - action in navigator context menu to compile ANTXR grammar files manually
  - action in navigator context menu to add/remove ANTXR project nature
    to/from the currently selected project
  - editor context menu 'Goto Rule' to navigate to rule under cursor
  - annotation hover for errors
  - text annotations for rules (first 10  lines of the rule's source code)
  - commenting and uncommenting (Ctrl+/ and Ctrl+\)
  - content assist for rules (Ctrl+Space)
  - leverage customizable keybinding facility of Eclipse 2.1
  - preferences page for editor's syntax highliting
  - Resource label decoration of ANTXR generated files with name of according
    grammar file
  - property page for grammar files which allows to specification of all
    command-line options

Requirements:
  - Eclipse 3.0 or 3.1
  - ANTXR plugin 'org.antxr_2.7.6'
  - ANTXR core plugin 'com.javadude.antxr.core_4.0.0'

How-to use:
  - disable Eclipse's Java compiler from copying ANTXR grammar file to the
    output directory by adding '*.g' to the filtered resources in the
    preferences (Window/Preferences/Java/Compiler/Other)
  - to use the automatic builder for ANTXR grammar files you have to add the
    ANTXR nature to the according project first (context menu 'Toggle ANTXR
    project nature'

Todo:
  - save grammar file if IObjectActionDelegate 'Compile Grammar' is invoked
  - add wizard to add/remove 'antxrnature' (with ANTXR's
    IncrementalProjectBuilder) to/from a project
  - create ANTXR specific icon for grammar file object
