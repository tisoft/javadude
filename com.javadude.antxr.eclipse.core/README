Core for ANTXR 2.7.6

Features:
  - project nature with incremental builder for ANTXR grammar files
  - conversion of ANTXR tool error output into resource markers
  - grammar source debugging
  - antxr project icon
  - improved error reporting
  - allow all command-line options to be specified in grammar property page
  - grammar properties are now stored in a .antxr-eclipse file so they can be checked in
  - fixed tab display for Eclipse 3.1
  - added command-line parameter display to generated files
  - all generated files (.java, .txt, .smap) now have antxr property pages
  - grammar compilation restricted to source directories if inside java project
  - automatic recognition of ANTXR XML plugin, registering it with ANTXR
  - automatic call to "organize imports" on generated code
  - "clean" command in eclipse removes all ANTXR-generated code
  - when building, generated files for deleted/renamed grammars are deleted


Requirements:
  - Eclipse 3.0 or 3.1
  - ANTXR plugin 'org.antxr_2.7.6'


Todo:
  - save grammar file if IObjectActionDelegate 'Compile Grammar' is invoked

History:
0.1.0
    - initial version -> not published
0.1.1
    - first public version
0.1.2
    - AntrlTool uses now own implementation of antxr.ToolErrorHandler
      (parsable error messages from Java code generator)
0.1.3
    - derived flag is set for generated files
    - better ANTXR error parsing (filtered "aborting grammar" messages)
    - added debug support (configurable via ".options" file)
    - incremental project builder is now added/removed correctly
0.1.4
    - during plugin startup "*.g" is added to JDT builder's copy
      exclusion filter
    - every file generated by ANTXR is marked with persistent property
      holding the according ANTXR grammar file - this is used in
      UI plugin by the label decorator
1.0.0
    - updated to ANTXR 2.7.2 final
1.0.1
    - outline grammar now supports iso-8859-15 characters and parser exceptions
      are recognized too
    - added resource properties for ANTXR compiler's output path and list of
      super grammar files
    - builder now supports ANTXR compiler options '-o' and '-glib'
1.0.2
    - builder now supports ANTXR compiler option '-glib' to be set via a
      single-line comment in the grammar file (// -glib <super grammar file>)
1.0.3
    - fixed bug in builder (NPE while checking for "*.g" file)
    - fixed bug in overview parser (NPE while parsing token section)
    - now the outline parser supports doc comments (grammars and rules only)

(no history present from 1.0.3 to 4.0.0)

4.0.0 (Scott Stanchfield)
    - updated to ANTXR 2.7.6
    - grammar source debugging
    - antxr project icon
    - improved error reporting
    - allow all command-line options to be specified in grammar property page
    - grammar properties are now stored in a .antxr-eclipse file so they can be checked in
    - fixed tab display for Eclipse 3.1
    - added command-line parameter display to generated files
    - all generated files (.java, .txt, .smap) now have antxr property pages
    - grammar compilation restricted to source directories if inside java project
    - automatic recognition of ANTXR XML plugin, registering it with ANTXR
    - automatic call to "organize imports" on generated code
    - "clean" command in eclipse removes all ANTXR-generated code
        (old invalid code generated for a grammar is removed when a grammar
         is recompiled)
    - when building, generated files for deleted/renamed grammars are deleted
