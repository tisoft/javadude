/**
 * Describes the access level of generated getter and setter methods.
 * <p>You can specify the access level in the Bean or Property annotations.</p>
 * <p>In the {@link Bean} annotation, the value you specify for reader or writer will be
 *   used as the default for all properties defined in the bean.</p>
 * <p>If the {@link Property} annotation, the value you specify for reader or writer will
 *   be used as the value for that property only.</p>
 * <p>Note that there is no "PRIVATE" access value. Because the annotations generate
 *   code in a superclass, there would be no way to use the generated getter or setter,
 *   so PRIVATE is unnecessary.</p>
 * <p>Some examples:</p>
 * <pre>@{@link Bean}(writer=Access.PROTECTED, reader=Access.NONE, ...)</pre>
 * <p>defines that by default, properties in this bean will be given a PROTECTED setter method
 * and no getter method.</p>
 * <pre>@{@link Bean}(...)</pre>
 * <p>defines that by default, all properties will have PUBLIC getters and setters.</p>
 * <pre>@{@link Property}(name="x", writer=Access.PROTECTED)</pre>
 * <p>defines a property named "x" with a protected setter. Its getter will default to the
 * access defined in the Bean annotation containing the {@link Property}.</p>
