If you want to build this in eclipse, simply checkout the source as an eclipse project and build it inside eclipse.

If you want to build using ANT, cd to the ant-build directory and run ant.

Note that the ant build uses a previous version of the antxr.jar called antxr-bootstrap.jar.
If you're modifying the antxr grammars to build a modified antxr, you should replace the antxr-bootstrap.jar with your generated antxr.jar.

In either case, DO NOT EDIT THE JAVA SOURCE IN THE "generated" DIRECTORY.
It is generated by antxr and will be overwritten.
